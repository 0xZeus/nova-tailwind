This [Laravel Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) package loads the full Tailwind CSS in the Nova admin panel.

## Installation

Install the package in a Laravel Nova project via Composer:

```bash
composer require optimistdigital/nova-tailwind
```

## Usage

Just install with Composer and you're good to go!

## Conflicts

The Tailwind configuration has been modified so it doesn't conflict with Laravel Nova's variation of Tailwind.

**If you do find some styles being overridden after installing this package, do make an issue and it can definitely be resolved.**
